# Future Shift Labs Website Development Plan

## Current Status and Issues

We've built a website for Future Shift Labs with the following components:
- Homepage with featured content and upcoming events
- Events listing page 
- Registration system for events
- Confirmation page for successful registrations

However, we're facing several issues:
1. Image loading problems in events pages
2. TypeScript errors related to image types
3. Need for improved error handling
4. Optimization for better performance

## Development Plan

### 1. Fix Immediate Image Issues (âœ… Completed)
- [x] Update `RegistrationEvent` interface to use proper types (`string | StaticImport`)
- [x] Add proper fallbacks to `OptimizedImage` components in registration pages
- [x] Ensure all event images have fallbacks using `EVENT_IMAGES.FALLBACK`

### 2. Improve Image Loading and Error Handling
- [ ] Review and enhance the `ImageErrorBoundary` component:
  - Add more comprehensive error reporting
  - Implement proper logging of image errors
  - Ensure proper fallback UI for all image failures
- [ ] Optimize the `registerImageErrorHandlers` function:
  - Call this function in the layout component on page load
  - Add caching mechanism to avoid re-triggering failed image loads

### 3. Registration System Enhancements
- [ ] Add form validation improvements:
  - Client-side validation with better error messages
  - Server-side validation in the API routes
  - Prevent duplicate submissions
- [ ] Implement loading states and better user feedback:
  - Add loading indicators during form submission
  - Improve success/error messaging
  - Ensure accessibility in all form components
- [ ] Add event capacity tracking:
  - Track available slots for events
  - Show "sold out" status when events are full
  - Waitlisting functionality for popular events

### 4. Data Management
- [ ] Replace mock data with proper data sources:
  - Create database schema for events and registrations
  - Set up API endpoints for fetching events and submitting registrations
  - Implement authentication for admin functionalities
- [ ] Create admin interface for managing events:
  - Add, edit, and delete events
  - View and manage registrations
  - Export registration data

### 5. User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced mobile experience:
  - Test and optimize all pages on mobile devices
  - Improve touch interactions for forms
  - Add responsive design improvements
- [ ] Performance optimizations:
  - Implement code splitting for faster page loads
  - Optimize image loading with better size handling
  - Add proper caching strategies
- [ ] Add progressive enhancement features:
  - Offline support for viewing registered events
  - Add to calendar functionality for all events
  - Sharing capabilities for events

### 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing:
  - Unit tests for critical components
  - Integration tests for form submissions
  - End-to-end tests for the registration flow
- [ ] Accessibility audit and improvements:
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Color contrast and readability
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing:
  - Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Ensure consistent experience across platforms

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 2: Registration System Enhancements (Weeks 2-3)
- Improve form validation and user feedback
- Implement capacity tracking
- Add waitlisting functionality

### Phase 3: Data Management (Weeks 4-6)
- Set up database and API endpoints
- Create admin interface
- Migrate from mock data to real data sources

### Phase 4: User Experience and Testing (Weeks 7-8)
- Enhance mobile experience

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up error tracking and monitoring
- Implement analytics to track user engagement
- Create regular maintenance schedule for updates

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a structured approach to improve the Future Shift Labs website, focusing on the events registration system. The immediate issues with images have been addressed, and the remaining tasks are organized into logical phases for efficient implementation.
